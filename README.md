This repo implements the SHA1 hash algorithm symbolically using the z3 SMT solver python API and its propositional logic / bitvector theories.
This allows formulating constraints on the inputs and outputs.

Of course this does not make it possible to break strong hashes because we quickly run into the exponentials!
But it nonetheless allows us to interactively explore the topic and find interesting pairs of inputs/outputs, like e.g. specific values at positions, fixed prefixes, or fixed suffixes.

TODO work in progress
